Hi, this is my fifth or sixth mod so far, and my FOURTH public one. Edit 2: I updated the mod to 1.16.4, I had to wait for the tool to update. Thanks for using my mod(s)!

 

Dreams

The Dream Minecraft Mod

By: Jaden LeMieux AKA JadensWebMC or misterrredstone.

 

So, my goal for this mod is to bring even more attention to the Dream Team (Which is another YouTube channel dedicated to 3 seperate YouTubers, Sapnap, GeorgeNotFound, and Dream), DreamXD, and the ever growing Dream channel.

I also wanted to feel like I made a mod worth anything. So, here we go!

This mod adds various objects and mobs to the game, even new music discs - That, when used, have some incredible properties.

For example, let's just say something very dangerous happens when Dream gets struck with lightning... Oh, boy! You'll have your work cut out for ya!

 

The mod comes with various sound clips that I borrowed from a few videos on the Dream channel, and from George's and Sapnap's channels too.

Yes, the music discs too!

They are all sound clips from funny moments that almost everyone agrees with that are the best ones. *WHEEZE*

 

I will be working on a mod spotlight on MY YouTube channel for this mod to dive deeper into it with greater detail in the future.

 

 

All Sound Clips In This Awesome Mod Were Brought To You By: The Dream Team; Dream; GeorgeNotFound; Sapnap; Dream Team; DreamXD; and Dream Tech!

Thank you guys for creating awesome content for us to enjoy!

 

For users that did not see this mod on the MCreator site, I had it removed as the moderators did not accept a mod with a thumbnail/image as "bad" as the one you clicked on now.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

 

I don't know why I have to mention this, people that leave comments should be at least a little more mature than this, but if you are thinking of leaving a comment like this kid, take a break. I don't need to tolerate any more drama than I want to, nor will I try to. Don't be like this kid:

 

And thanks for thinking about trying out my mod!
